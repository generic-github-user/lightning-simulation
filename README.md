# Lightning Simulation

A simple lightning simulator and renderer written in Python. It does not aim to be scientifically accurate, only to produce visually interesting and somewhat lifelike images of simulated lightning with a reasonable degree of customizability.

The program uses basic fluid simulation principles; the simulation is modeled as an electrical potential field that dictates where current travels through a medium (e.g., the atmosphere). The lightning itself is represented as a series of paths taken by particles (electric charge) during a discrete-time simulation. The particles' motion is thus determined by their position in the previous timestep, factors influencing the electric field (essentially a function of the particle's position), and some random noise (hence the "stochastic"). (I have probably committed flagrant abuse of technical terminology, but hopefully this communicates the main points somewhat clearly).
